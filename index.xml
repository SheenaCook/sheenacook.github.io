      <description>bam - someone who is foolish, disruptive, annoying, obnoxious slàinte mhath - (pronounced Slanj-a-va) cheers dram - a small drink of whisky Aye it’s deemed Scotland’s national drink Afore you consume stop and think A wee nightcap before ya bed Relaxes and slows a busy head Just one for the road and ya’ll go Into the night with a cosy glow Try not to despise The advice of the “worldly wise” Clutching the bottle to your chest Ignoring what’s for the best When peer pressure’s stalking It’ll be the drink doin the talking Remember the amber liquid’s charm Is known to unleash untold harm Very few are protected from the spell Casting loved ones into living hell Stevenson wrote of Jekyll and Hyde Perhaps the demonic whisky slide A measure to raise a toast Ne’er suited to excessive boast The best malts require celebration Refined and savoured in moderation Be admired for who you are Only one generous “Slainte mhath”.</description>

      <description>Even on the dampest day
Blackbirds cheerily play
Tail fans and chatter
Gather for a natter
Filling bare trees
Flutter and tease
Blackbirds style
It makes us smile</description>

      <description>Following the paths meander Carpets of snowdrops nod To their fellow hellebores Shy crocuses, cheery aconites Euphorbias delighted backdrop Proud orchard trees impress A solitary medlar on a branch Sinous trees reach out Mulberry wisely signifies nature Invokes our faith in nature too Mediterranean courtyard on a February day Grateful to be the sole visitors Time for reflection and introspection Looking at the details everywhere Honesty amongst the pots, the beds and barns Greenhouse a haven of warmth Inhale the comforting scents Succulents the hidden hermits As geraniums slumber in terracotta Propagation and hibernation&#39;s lair The gardens gently nurtured Self seeding encouraged; an informality Blooms the bountiful gifts That walls last to embrace And protect so much beauty within The Ravens who created here Were insightful and reflective Along with their loyal gardeners There is honour in what is shared Attuned to horticultural heraldry</description>

      <description>Why try? Why try to be dry? What might occur? A social slur Whining for wine A vodkaless void All things fizzy Make you dizzy Don’t really care for alcopops Always taste of sugary slops Avoid ruthless piratical rum No making merry with sherry Life feels queer Without beer Whistfully wishing for whisky Gin a major sin Acting with glee Faced with herbal tea Fortified by water Filling us with cheer The challenge of staying clear Of any percentage proof Might make us appear Sensible and aloof Please don’t judge When we try To get through January dry</description>

      <description>Forsooth, perhaps, or strewth. A glimmer of truth. Were the words of a witch? Trigger for a power crazed bitch. All that nocturnal wandering. Suggested she was pondering. Her and the thane’s wrongdoing. A miasma of guilt brewing. Rambling about the damned spot. Menopausal, sweaty and hot. The misguided onus on ambition. Resulting in insomnia and contrition. And there be the truth. Lady Macbeth just long in the tooth.</description>

      <description>Pumpkin transformed to a mushy blob, On completion of it’s fearsome job. Cosmos sentinel below a tree. White flowers natural purity. Silent kite floats suspended high. In the grey stillness of the sky. Raking, spreading compost around. Robin brazen on the ground. Then school noises rise, Lunchtime’s whoops and cries. Watch more leaves flutter down. Only warrant a momentary frown. Empty mugs perched on the wall. Gratefully we’d emptied them all.</description>

      <description>Trees slumber. Leaves dress the drive. Damp and dank, Tannins leach brown. Stretch and rake, Rake and gather. Piles grow. Slow……slow…… The next season, Settling in your heart. Satisfaction in effort, That rooks applaud.</description>

      <description>There is a reason and story behind this but it is disguised here in a tale. One of those that is as old as time I am sure.
Barely Bitter Betty Buttercup Sent to work for Farmer Barleymow Her mother made a show. Betty was earning a honest day’s pay. Back when she didn’t have much to say. The farmer’s first wife died of consumption. In hindsight locals had a presumption; Barleymow’s eagerness to produce an heir.</description>

      <description>Cancelled Wedding Day Sorry it was your special day Only when a reminder pinged did I say ”Oh it was supposed to be Charlotte and Danielle’s wedding day” This year’s plan has gone But hey ho the sun shone I’ve planted seeds And pulled up weeds Didn’t get to put on my gladrags Dance away from handbags Hopefully you feel no resentment Rather blessed with happiness and contentment</description>

      <description>Avoided, unsightly Fearsome thorns that tear. Stop and consider. Listen to birdsong Heralding security within. An insectivorous city Retreat for modest mammals. Gallery of the spider’s webs, Enhanced by crystal dew. Pastel papery flowers. Nectar gatherers buzz, or flutter on elegant wings. A thriving natural community. Self sufficient relinquisher of black pearled berries. We will gratefully share. Appreciate that blackberry thicket For just being there.</description>

      <description>I was tired of looking shady, my hair was too long Like a dislillusioned hippy with a favourite bong So while I lay there sleepin’, I had a dream in my head I was on the front page of a paper I’d recently read &amp;quot;f you hear this man singing, quickly exit the train If you’re not into yoga, if you have half a brain If you like making love at midnight after a game of Runescape Then no amount of cocktails will help you escape” I no longer felt shady, I felt renewed and rather keen But surfin and jet skiing ain’t part of my normal routine So I reinvented myself to look like a younger lad I’m not really a rapper but wrote something not bad Yes, I like playing Peggy and singing on the train I’m not much into health food, I am into champagne I’ve go to groove it out until tomorrow and create a soundscape At a bar on the high street we’ll plan our escape So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place I knew her smile in an instant, the teeth with a brace It was a strangely blue lady and she said “Oh it’s you?</description>

      <description>With the name of Sheena Cook Likened to a common crook A haunting spook Is it such a fluke? That you really dare To believe you could have a flair That you really dare To write poems of note Not if it’s Sheena Cook you wrote In order to bring to an end Hastily written words that could offend</description>

      <description>When attending a less than exhilarating course To stay focused requires concentration of superhuman force My fingers will begin to wander across my facial skin Inevitably discovering a wiry whisker protruding from my chin Then my train of thought begins to meander To colleagues possible comments and slander ”Oh have you seen that bearded woman?” Never heeding facial depilation is positively subhuman Trying to pluck it out with stumpy fingernails Strong and defiant, of course that fails Why?</description>

      <description>The day was grey I ran and it was windy Then we headed out to walk And we talked The green corn swished Cows and horse grazed A hawk hovered Nothing much was bothered In our passing by Still the clouds covered the sky. Sitting in a pub with pale ale A tin mug of pork scratchings An excited couple from London Visitors keen to chat This and that The beer, the building Next an elaborate woman in red Sat with a man sho spoke on his phone Of grouting tiles, smoking Sterling King Size She ate giant marshmallows Drank coffee and her name was Debbie.</description>

      <description>Dark hedgerows where scarlet berries hang Robins who stop to meet your eye Flocks of birds soaring high Pushing the clouds to reveal blue sky And as you walk many a mile Remember there’s been much that made you smile Two dogs hurtle by Proven loyalty makes you sigh A realisation in this open space Family and friends are yours to embrace</description>

      <description>Social media Communal hysteria Misinterpreted texting Cringeworthy sexting Phone know your place! This is my mind space Facebook stalking No time for walking All that’s Twitter Makes me jitter Technology chaos theory Some think me dreary True friends look you in the eye Virtual ones can lie, lie, lie Make time for reality In a tech free principality</description>

      <description>A spot that came to stay I was firm and endeavoured to chase it away Then it was like it moved in next door And became more difficult to ignore Your must admire it’s tenacity Whilst from friends came only pity I now fear more will come and join it A red, festive, glowing zit</description>

      <description>As I read and toss in my bed Grey skies fill me with a longing for sun My mind wanders across the span Of all of those memories and reasons For the things I have done Nothing is more apparent than my slightness In the whole scheme of the world Therefore it is with warmth I cling to the love of those I love For I know full well there are those Who have known love at a price The smallest happenings can bring The wonder which helps us forget Hurts and sadness Let yourself stop to enjoy them As they can be caught in a suns ray Only in the passing of time</description>
