      <description>Trapped in a gilet Looking like a Hooray I borrowed it to keep warm Now my face is red it’s hotter than my bed The zip is dodgy My frame looks podgy Trapped in a gilet Hardly a crisis siutation On release a tiny celebration.</description>

      <description>bam - someone who is foolish, disruptive, annoying, obnoxious slainte mhath - (pronounced swan-g-var) cheers dram - a small drink of whisky Aye it’s deemed Scotland’s national drink Afore you consume stop and think A wee nightcap before ya bed Relaxes and slows a busy head Just one for the road and ya’ll go Into the night with a cosy glow Try not to despise The advice of the “worldly wise” Clutching the bottle to your chest Ignoring what’s for the best When peer pressure’s stalking It’ll be the drink doin the talking Remember the amber liquid’s charm Is known to unleash untold harm Very few are protected from the spell Casting loved ones inot living hell Stevenson wrote of Jekyll and Hyde Perhaps the demonic whisky slide A measure to raise a toast Ne’er suited to excessive boast The best malts require celebration Refined and savoured in moderation Be admired for who you are Only one generous “Slainte mhath”.</description>

      <description>Even on the dampest day
Blackbirds cheerily play
Tail fans and chatter
Gather for a natter
Filling bare trees
Flutter and tease
Blackbirds style
It makes us smile</description>

Following the paths meander Carpets of snowdrops nod To their fellow hellebores Shy crocuses, cheery aconites Euphorbias delighted backdrop Proud orchard trees impress A solitary medlar on abranch Sinous trees reach out Mulberry wisely signifies nature Invokes our faith in nature too Mediterranean courtyard on a February day Grateful to be the sole visitors Time for reflection and introspection Looking at the details everywhere Honesty amongst the pots, the beds and barns Greenhouse a haven of warmth Inhale the comnforting scents Succulents the hidden hermits AS geraniums slumber in terracotta Propagation and hibernations lair The gardens gently nurtured Self seeding encouraged; an informality Blooms the bountiful gifts That walls last to embrace And protect so much beauty within The Ravens who created here Were insihgtful and reflective Along with their loyal gardeners There is honour in what is shared Attuned to horticultural heraldry </description>

      <description>Apricity - feeling the sun’s warmth in winter. I loved this word and it falls alongside this poem Confident huddles Frosted foreground In the lee of hedges Purity nodding Come Spring Come Spring.</description>
