      <description>Breakfast and banter Who&#39;s the ranter? Eggs Benedict Diet not strict? Stop talking about dead mice It&#39;s really not nice Stories of road kill A tale to thrill! Definetely right To be dining room polite Watch what you say During the communal start to the day.</description>

      <description>If ifs and ands were&amp;hellip;.. The actions that caused a stir Out on the green it ain&#39;t bowls A pitch is for scoring goals Place your bet For several in the net Chants and cheers Derision loud and angry jeers. Come on give it a rest The players did their best Rerun chatter, banter abounds As the folks leave the grounds Always a mission To move to the next division.</description>
