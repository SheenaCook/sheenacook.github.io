      <description>The fire dances in the centre Circled by the painted caravans Wooden wagons embrace Voices rise and fall Sparks flurry before they fall She nods to those who notice Feet treading the dewy grass Dogs curled beneath steps Ignore her lantern&#39;s glow Above floors creak and windows glow A breeze riffles the flags The Big Top&#39;s only stirring Owl hoots approval As the circus prepares to sleep Strongman snoring;rumbling sleep Bareback ballerina&#39;s horse Crops meadow grass Snowy unicorn white Solid in the moonlight Mane shimmers by moonlight On the riverbank She hangs her clothes Upon outstretched branch Wades into the amber water Floats in the flowing water Swimming by the swans serene The river&#39;s their stage for grace Scars tingle a reminder She accepts her beauty within Doubt ebbs away,contentment within Willows trail the surface From the shadows she emerges Stands modestly statuesque Let&#39;s her skin dry naturally The stars see her naturally Drifting back to the fire She takes her place Beside the few that dally This a travelling community Now her close knit community Embers fade with kisses &amp;lsquo;Goodnight&amp;rsquo; Acts left in the sawdust ring She strokes the piebald by her tent Breaths this restful moment Foresees the next dream moment</description>
