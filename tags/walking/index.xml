      <description>A steadiness as that river flows Tree colours natural heraldry Swimming swagger of trout River festival of ducks, geese, gulls The sky a blue canvas Clouds roil in a temporary grey Cattle graze a placid Autumn And we walk through it Feeling gratitude for the grandeur</description>

      <description>The day was grey I ran and it was windy Then we headed out to walk And we talked The green corn swished Cows and horse grazed A hawk hovered Nothing much was bothered In our passing by Still the clouds covered the sky. Sitting in a pub with pale ale A tin mug of pork scratchings An excited couple from London Visitors keen to chat This and that The beer, the building Next an elaborate woman in red Sat with a man sho spoke on his phone Of grouting tiles, smoking Sterling King Size She ate giant marshmallows Drank coffee and her name was Debbie.</description>
