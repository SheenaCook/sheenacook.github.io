      <description>Following the paths meander Carpets of snowdrops nod To their fellow hellebores Shy crocuses, cheery aconites Euphorbias delighted backdrop Proud orchard trees impress A solitary medlar on abranch Sinous trees reach out Mulberry wisely signifies nature Invokes our faith in nature too Mediterranean courtyard on a February day Grateful to be the sole visitors Time for reflection and introspection Looking at the details everywhere Honesty amongst the pots, the beds and barns Greenhouse a haven of warmth Inhale the comnforting scents Succulents the hidden hermits AS geraniums slumber in terracotta Propagation and hibernations lair The gardens gently nurtured Self seeding encouraged; an informality Blooms the bountiful gifts That walls last to embrace And protect so much beauty within The Ravens who created here Were insihgtful and reflective Along with their loyal gardeners There is honour in what is shared Attuned to horticultural heraldry</description>

      <description>Trees slumber. Leaves dress the drive. Damp and dank, Tannins leach brown. Stretch and rake, Rake and gather. Piles grow. Slow……slow…… The next season, Settling in your heart. Satisfactin in effort, That rooks applaud.</description>

      <description>Avoided, unsightly Fearsome thorns that tear. Stop and consider. Listen to birdsong Heralding security within. An insectivorous city Retreat for modest mammals. Gallery of the spider’s webs, Enhanced by crystal dew. Pastel papery flowers. Nectar gatherers buzz, or flutter on elegant wings. A thriving natural community. Self sufficient relinquisher of black pearled berries. We will gratefully share. Appreciate that blackberry thicket For just being there.</description>
