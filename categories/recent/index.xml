      <description>The fire dances in the centre Circled by the painted caravans Wooden wagons embrace Voices rise and fall Sparks flurry before they fall She nods to those who notice Feet treading the dewy grass Dogs curled beneath steps Ignore her lantern&#39;s glow Above floors creak and windows glow A breeze riffles the flags The Big Top&#39;s only stirring Owl hoots approval As the circus prepares to sleep Strongman snoring; rumbling sleep Bareback ballerina&#39;s horse Crops meadow grass Snowy unicorn white Solid in the moonlight Mane shimmers by moonlight On the riverbank She hangs her clothes Upon outstretched branch Wades into the amber water Floats in the flowing water Swimming by the swans serene The river&#39;s their stage for grace Scars tingle a reminder She accepts her beauty within Doubt ebbs away, contentment within Willows trail the surface From the shadows she emerges Stands modestly statuesque Let&#39;s her skin dry naturally The stars see her naturally Drifting back to the fire She takes her place Beside the few that dally This a travelling community Now her close knit community Embers fade with kisses &amp;lsquo;Goodnight&amp;rsquo; Acts left in the sawdust ring She strokes the piebald by her tent Breaths this restful moment Foresees the next dream moment</description>

      <description>A day after persistent rain. Spring sun the garden&#39;s gain. Clearing beds revealing green Locating plants yet unseen. Gladioli bulbs, orange and pink. I put them where I think, The path will be their catwalk. Each bold statement blooming stalk. We know the hurt war has cast. Make it stop! Please let if be the past. The news breaks our hearts. Still Spring uplifts and starts. Robin opportunistically near, Reminder of those held dear.</description>

      <description>I would&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;. Plant my oak saplings Wildwood edge it Native trees Flowers for bees Green tunnel to lead you in With reclaimed stone Build a folly Mystic and mossy Create a dewpond In a clearing Where wild animals roam Wish for a &amp;lsquo;Wood Wide Web&amp;rsquo; Of fungi to spread Long for birds To sculpt their nests An area to coppice A place to rest Stand a Green Man there Alive with dappled light Symbolising the wisdom Of a holistic woodland idyll</description>

      <description>Every hour on the hour I&#39;m gonna kiss a cauliflower Then I sigh and frown Still not garlicky cauli hash brown Pleading, wheedling &amp;ldquo;Please, Please&amp;rdquo; An indulgent triple cauliflower cheese&amp;rdquo; But stolidly it will remain A pale brassically brain</description>

      <title>Don’t be a bam just take a dram</title>

      <description>bam - someone who is foolish, disruptive, annoying, obnoxious slàinte mhath - (pronounced Slanj-a-va) cheers dram - a small drink of whisky Aye it’s deemed Scotland’s national drink Afore you consume stop and think A wee nightcap before ya bed Relaxes and slows a busy head Just one for the road and ya’ll go Into the night with a cosy glow Try not to despise The advice of the “worldly wise” Clutching the bottle to your chest Ignoring what’s for the best When peer pressure’s stalking It’ll be the drink doin the talking Remember the amber liquid’s charm Is known to unleash untold harm Very few are protected from the spell Casting loved ones into living hell Stevenson wrote of Jekyll and Hyde Perhaps the demonic whisky slide A measure to raise a toast Ne’er suited to excessive boast The best malts require celebration Refined and savoured in moderation Be admired for who you are Only one generous “Slainte mhath”.</description>

      <description>His belongings sat in the hall Close to the door Everything fitted snugly into his boxes Expensive black and chrome gear Up to date PC and state of the art sculpture His coffee grinder and her toaster Her belongings strewn around the bedroom Some in boxes, some in bags Bits and pieces, memories he’d called junk Things they’d collected on the beach Heaps of clothes bought to impress Slowly wrapping mugs in paper She stared at a crossword he’d completed The cat softly rubbed against her leg Her cat now, she started to cry With a tea towel she dried her face And carefully avoided a swollen black eye</description>
