      <description>Why try? Why try to be dry? What might occur? A social slur Whining for wine A vodkaless void All things ifzzy Make you dizzy Don’t really care for alcopops Always taste of sugary slops Avoid ruthless piratical rum&amp;lt; No making merry with sherry Life feels queer Without beer Whistfully wishing for whisky Gin a major sin Acting with glee Faced with herbal tea Fortified by water Filling us with cheer The challneg of staying clear Of any percentage proof Might make us appear Sensible and aloof Please don’t judge When we try To get through January dry</description>
