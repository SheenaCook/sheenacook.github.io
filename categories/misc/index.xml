      <description>Cancelled Wedding Day Sorry it was your special day Only when a reminder pinged did I say ”Oh it was supposed to be Charlotte and Danielle’s wedding day” This year’s plan has gone But hey ho the sun shone I’ve planted seeds And pulled up weeds Didn’t get to put on my gladrags Dance away from handbags Hopefully you feel no resentment Rather blessed with happiness and contentment</description>

I speculate A knitted lampshade Oh dust will gather there Cable knit leotard Chaffing despair Moss stitched magazine cover Beyond rational comprehension Draw the line at a thong If you struggle with your tension.</description>
