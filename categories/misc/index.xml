      <title>Don’t be a bam just take a dram</title>

      <description>bam - someone who is foolish, disruptive, annoying, obnoxious slàinte mhath - (pronounced Slanj-a-va) cheers dram - a small drink of whisky Aye it’s deemed Scotland’s national drink Afore you consume stop and think A wee nightcap before ya bed Relaxes and slows a busy head Just one for the road and ya’ll go Into the night with a cosy glow Try not to despise The advice of the “worldly wise” Clutching the bottle to your chest Ignoring what’s for the best When peer pressure’s stalking It’ll be the drink doin the talking Remember the amber liquid’s charm Is known to unleash untold harm Very few are protected from the spell Casting loved ones into living hell Stevenson wrote of Jekyll and Hyde Perhaps the demonic whisky slide A measure to raise a toast Ne’er suited to excessive boast The best malts require celebration Refined and savoured in moderation Be admired for who you are Only one generous “Slainte mhath”.</description>

      <description>Cancelled Wedding Day Sorry it was your special day Only when a reminder pinged did I say ”Oh it was supposed to be Charlotte and Danielle’s wedding day” This year’s plan has gone But hey ho the sun shone I’ve planted seeds And pulled up weeds Didn’t get to put on my gladrags Dance away from handbags Hopefully you feel no resentment Rather blessed with happiness and contentment</description>

      <description>Distress sealed in a bottle Grief cast out to sea Rolled, roiled, tumbled Returned to shore. It’s energy and strength Releases sea glass A smooth survivor Every piece unique.</description>

      <description>A fascination born of Flicking through pattern folders Reading books on cafe shelves And browsing crafter’s stalls Why? I speculate A knitted lampshade Oh dust will gather there Cable knit leotard Chaffing despair Moss stitched magazine cover Beyond rational comprehension Draw the line at a thong If you struggle with your tension.</description>

      <description>That coveted Christmas present Parents eager to please, their intent The wrapping paper cast aside Wrestled the zord from inside Impressive box, plastic cocoon Awe inspiring demonstration soon Crestfallen the realisation is quick Appealing to know what’s the trick The advertising lie It couldn’t really fly</description>

      <description>Spilling out onto the street Hidden behind in shadow Better for a gaggle Clubbers playing it over Underworld, hands in the air Through your head Loved up, hyped up Not ready for yer bed Keep talking &amp;quot;Who’s walking?” Watch the sunrise From Arthur’s Seat A shove, a push, a gentle nudge Lounging on the hillside Drying sweat Disparate dialogue Chat, chat, chat Enough being clever Enough of that Stretch out, lie back Up ’til dawn The light greets us And weariness sweeps us Down the slope Friendly green kaleidoscope ”Ye off home” ”Aye great night” ”See yas all” Parting of the ways Smiles, waves, smiles Sunrise across the miles.</description>

Lad and dog snoozing Through dreamland cruising Heavy sighs, occassional twitch In somnolence not a glitch Peace and calm shared is best Winter naps luxury rest </description>

      <description>With the name of Sheena Cook Likened to a common crook A haunting spook Is it such a fluke? That you really dare To believe you could have a flair That you really dare To write poems of note Not if it’s Sheena Cook you wrote In order to bring to an end Hastily written words that could offend</description>

      <description>His belongings sat in the hall Close to the door Everything fitted snugly into his boxes Expensive black and chrome gear Up to date PC and state of the art sculpture His coffee grinder and her toaster Her belongings strewn around the bedroom Some in boxes, some in bags Bits and pieces, memories he’d called junk Things they’d collected on the beach Heaps of clothes bought to impress Slowly wrapping mugs in paper She stared at a crossword he’d completed The cat softly rubbed against her leg Her cat now, she started to cry With a tea towel she dried her face And carefully avoided a swollen black eye</description>
