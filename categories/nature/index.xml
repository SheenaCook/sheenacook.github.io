      <description>A steadiness as that river flows Tree colours natural heraldry Swimming swagger of trout River festival of ducks, geese, gulls The sky a blue canvas Clouds roil in a temporary grey Cattle graze a placid Autumn And we walk through it Feeling gratitude for the grandeur</description>

      <description>Even on the dampest day
Blackbirds cheerily play
Tail fans and chatter
Gather for a natter
Filling bare trees
Flutter and tease
Blackbirds style
It makes us smile</description>

      <description>Following the paths meander Carpets of snowdrops nod To their fellow hellebores Shy crocuses, cheery aconites Euphorbias delighted backdrop Proud orchard trees impress A solitary medlar on a branch Sinous trees reach out Mulberry wisely signifies nature Invokes our faith in nature too Mediterranean courtyard on a February day Grateful to be the sole visitors Time for reflection and introspection Looking at the details everywhere Honesty amongst the pots, the beds and barns Greenhouse a haven of warmth Inhale the comforting scents Succulents the hidden hermits As geraniums slumber in terracotta Propagation and hibernation&#39;s lair The gardens gently nurtured Self seeding encouraged; an informality Blooms the bountiful gifts That walls last to embrace And protect so much beauty within The Ravens who created here Were insightful and reflective Along with their loyal gardeners There is honour in what is shared Attuned to horticultural heraldry</description>

      <description>Apricity - feeling the sun’s warmth in winter. I loved this word and it falls alongside this poem Confident huddles Frosted foreground In the lee of hedges Purity nodding Come Spring! Come Spring!</description>

      <description>Sun and frost cast Mist rises on a scene Hedges screen Fields of winter barley My misguided longing For the simplicity of Working the land I run with history That of natural beauty.</description>

      <description>Pumpkin transformed to a mushy blob, On completion of it’s fearsome job. Cosmos sentinel below a tree. White flowers natural purity. Silent kite floats suspended high. In the grey stillness of the sky. Raking, spreading compost around. Robin brazen on the ground. Then school noises rise, Lunchtime’s whoops and cries. Watch more leaves flutter down. Only warrant a momentary frown. Empty mugs perched on the wall. Gratefully we’d emptied them all.</description>

      <description>Trees slumber. Leaves dress the drive. Damp and dank, Tannins leach brown. Stretch and rake, Rake and gather. Piles grow. Slow……slow…… The next season, Settling in your heart. Satisfaction in effort, That rooks applaud.</description>

      <description>Avoided, unsightly Fearsome thorns that tear. Stop and consider. Listen to birdsong Heralding security within. An insectivorous city Retreat for modest mammals. Gallery of the spider’s webs, Enhanced by crystal dew. Pastel papery flowers. Nectar gatherers buzz, or flutter on elegant wings. A thriving natural community. Self sufficient relinquisher of black pearled berries. We will gratefully share. Appreciate that blackberry thicket For just being there.</description>

      <description>Bright dawn A silent sentinel On a gate post Staring perfection Bringer of truth Open my eyes To nature’s calm You rise transient Fly shafts of light And gone. Two years on Spiritual stare I question why Maybe always there At peace, serene Wildly wise.</description>

      <description>A canoe on a river We’re the ballast Easy motion Paddles slice water Pewter translucence Rocks soft yellow green Weeds tendril stream We proceed with rhythm:by Swans indifferently serene Kingfisher’s electric flash Reflective purling stretches Momentarily hastens progress Towards Symonds Yat And with regret we leave A river&#39;s, sinous steady grace.</description>

      <description>Dark hedgerows where scarlet berries hang Robins who stop to meet your eye Flocks of birds soaring high Pushing the clouds to reveal blue sky And as you walk many a mile Remember there’s been much that made you smile Two dogs hurtle by Proven loyalty makes you sigh A realisation in this open space Family and friends are yours to embrace</description>
