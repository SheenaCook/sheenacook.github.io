      <description>Even on the dampest day
Blackbirds cheerily play
Tail fans and chatter
Gather for a natter
Filling bare trees
Flutter and tease
Blackbirds style
It makes us smile</description>

      <description>Following the paths meander Carpets of snowdrops nod To their fellow hellebores Shy crocuses, cheery aconites Euphorbias delighted backdrop Proud orchard trees impress A solitary medlar on abranch Sinous trees reach out Mulberry wisely signifies nature Invokes our faith in nature too Mediterranean courtyard on a February day Grateful to be the sole visitors Time for reflection and introspection Looking at the details everywhere Honesty amongst the pots, the beds and barns Greenhouse a haven of warmth Inhale the comnforting scents Succulents the hidden hermits AS geraniums slumber in terracotta Propagation and hibernations lair The gardens gently nurtured Self seeding encouraged; an informality Blooms the bountiful gifts That walls last to embrace And protect so much beauty within The Ravens who created here Were insihgtful and reflective Along with their loyal gardeners There is honour in what is shared Attuned to horticultural heraldry</description>

      <description>Apricity - feeling the sun’s warmth in winter. I loved this word and it falls alongside this poem Confident huddles Frosted foreground In the lee of hedges Purity nodding Come Spring Come Spring.</description>

      <description>Sun and frost cast Mist rises on a scene Hedges screen Fields of winter barley My misguided longing For the simplicity of Working the land I run with history That of natural beauty.</description>

      <description>Ground frost Makes digging slow Robin watches as I go Beady eyes Bare branch vantage Uncovered habitat advantage Flutters to earth Feeds in the wake Of spades thunk and quake Bold observer Jauntily tilted head Gratefully well fed Gardener&#39;s friends In winter’s fading light Robins brings us bright</description>

      <description>Pumpkin transformed to a mushy blob, On completion of it’s fearsome job. Cosmos sentinel below a tree. White flowers natural purity. Silent kite floats suspended high. In the grey stillness of the sky. Raking, spreading compost around. Robin brazen on the ground. Then school noises rise, Lunchtime’s whoops and cries. Watch more leaves flutter down. Only warrant a momentary frown. Empty mugs perched on the wall. Gratefully we’d emptied them all.</description>

      <description>Trees slumber. Leaves dress the drive. Damp and dank, Tannins leach brown. Stretch and rake, Rake and gather. Piles grow. Slow……slow…… The next season, Settling in your heart. Satisfactin in effort, That rooks applaud.</description>
